debathena-aclocal (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * PKG_CHECK_MODULES doesn't split LDFLAGS and LIBS properly. Since we
    need to insert com_err's LDFLAGS before AFS's, but since -lcom_err
    needs to be after the object files, we need this split. So,
    reimplement what we need of it and just use PKG_CHECK_EXISTS.

debathena-aclocal (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If we're going to use pkg-config's macros, having pkg-config
    installed is probably a good plan.

debathena-aclocal (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make ATHENA_UTIL_COM_ERR use pkg-config to find com_err's location
    (and set CFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS as pkg-config wants), and prefix
    CFLAGS and LDFLAGS so as to cause the normal com_err to be found in
    preference to AFS' variant.

debathena-aclocal (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial commit.
